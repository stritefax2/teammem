WHEN TO USE:
- You're looking for something in a native collection (Decisions, Meeting Notes, Insights, Agent Observations)
- You're looking for a specific row in a synced table that has a content_column (see list_collections) — semantic search only hits text columns, never structured fields
- You have a fuzzy natural-language question

WHEN NOT TO USE:
- You need to filter by exact field values (status = 'at_risk', mrr > 1000) — use query_structured instead
- The target collection is synced and has no content_column — search will return zero results from it; use query_structured

Returns entries ranked by semantic similarity (requires OPENAI_API_KEY on the server) or full-text match.

- "What did we decide about Q3 pricing?" (Decisions collection)
- "Customer feedback mentioning latency" (if notes column is indexed)

TYPICAL USES:
- Synced customers/orders/products tables from Postgres: "active enterprise customers", "orders above $10k from last month"

WORKFLOW:
1. list_collections (once per conversation) — returns queryable_fields for each collection

    {"field": "plan", "op": "eq", "value": "enterprise"},
    {"field": "status", "op": "eq", "value": "at_risk"}

- Content is longer than ~1 page

This is the right tool for "how many", "what's the total", "average per category" questions. It's deliberately NOT raw SQL: fields you reference are validated, write operations are impossible, and any field redacted for your agent key will cause a loud 403 instead of a silent leak.

WHEN TO USE (prefer this over query_structured for):
- "Total MRR by plan" → group_by: ["plan"], aggregations: [{op: "sum", field: "mrr"}]
- "Count of customers by status" → group_by: ["status"], aggregations: [{op: "count"}]
- "Average deal size for active enterprise customers" → filters + single avg aggregation
- "Top 5 plans by customer count" → group_by + count + order_by + limit

PARAMETERS:
  collection (required): the collection ID
  aggregations (required, 1-10): array of {op, field?, alias?}
    • op: "count" | "sum" | "avg" | "min" | "max"
    • field: column name from queryable_fields (required except for bare count)
    • alias: optional output name; defaults to "\${op}_\${field}" or "count"
  group_by (optional, max 5 fields): column names to group by
  filters (optional, max 20): same shape as query_structured — eq/neq/gt/gte/lt/lte/contains/in
  having (optional, max 5): post-aggregate numeric filters on aliases
  order_by (optional): { alias, direction: "asc" | "desc" }
  limit (optional, max 500, default 100)

  1. SYNCED (read-only): mirrors of tables from an external database (Postgres, Supabase, etc.). Examples: customers, orders, products. Query with query_structured. Never try to write — writes return 409 read_only_source. To change data, the user has to update it in the source DB.

  2. NATIVE (writable): team-written entries — Decisions, Meeting Notes, Insights, Agent Observations. Query with search (for prose) or query_structured (for typed fields). Write with write_entry / update_entry / store_document.

## Start every new conversation with list_collections
This returns, per collection: synced flag, writable flag, queryable_fields, content_column, recommended_tool. Routing every subsequent tool call correctly depends on this.

## Picking the right tool

User asks about data in a SYNCED table:
  → For "how many / total / average / per-category" questions → aggregate (never pull rows into the LLM to count them by hand)
  → For "find me records matching X" → query_structured with filters on queryable_fields
  → For fuzzy text search in a content_column → search
  → Cite the specific rows you found ("4 matching customers: c_01, c_22, c_44, c_78")

User asks about decisions, notes, or anything text-shaped in a NATIVE collection:
  → search with a specific natural-language query
  → query_structured if they're asking for entries tagged with specific fields
  → Always include where the information came from ("per the decision log from March 14...")

User asks a question that combines both ("Which enterprise customers were discussed in recent meetings?"):
  → query_structured for the enterprise customers
  → search in Meeting Notes for each customer name
  → Join the two sets and summarize

## When to proactively save to a native collection

Save when the conversation produces something the team should remember:
- **Decisions**: "We're going with..." "The plan is..." "We decided..."
- **Observations linked to synced data**: "4 of our enterprise customers flagged pricing — linked: customers#c_01, c_22, c_44, c_78"
- **Summaries of calls/meetings**: action items, attendees, outcomes
- **Research findings** worth persisting

When you detect one, ask: "Want me to save this to Rhona?" Then list_collections → write_entry (short) or store_document (long).

## Safety rules
- Never attempt to write to a synced collection — it will fail and waste a turn.
- If a user asks you to modify customer data, explain you can only read it here; they need to change it in the source database.
- Respect column redactions — if a field you expect isn't in the response, your key doesn't have access to it.

## What NOT to save
- Casual chat, small talk, temporary context
- Anything the user says is private or not for the team
- Raw query results from synced collections (they'd just duplicate data that's already mirrored)`,
